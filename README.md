MLB scraper app

This one never really got off the ground. I was able to use lesson 20 to save article headlines and links to a Mongo DB but I couldn't ever get them to display on my web app.

Node threw errors for lines of code that were copied perfectly from classRepo such as "db.Article.create isn't a function." Not sure what to make of that.

I believe I required all of the necessary packages and set up my app the same way as lesson 20 but it naever worked the same way. Bringing in Handlebars likely didn't halp matters.

I deployed the app to Heroku (unsuccessfully) but the mLab deployment didn't appear to take either following the instructions from Git-Lab.

Solutions described in class and on classRepo seem to vary. Position in of variables like "var results" appear to be in different scope locations in lessons 06 and 20. Either way, moving things around didn't seem to help.

Onward and upward.
